# Endless-Runner

Welcome to one of my very first Python games I made using PyGame!
This game allows you to take control of a character and hop into a endless runner world, where you jump and duck your way to a new highscore!

Future update plans:
  1) Multiple character options
  2) Adding database to keep track of players and their highscores
  3) Adding a dark mode
  4) Adding more background options
